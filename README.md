🚜 Development of Dharani Rover 🌱🔬  

Dharani Rover is a six-wheeled autonomous agricultural and environmental monitoring robot 🤖🚜, equipped with a rocker-bogie suspension system 🏔️ and a robotic arm 🦾 for soil analysis. It measures soil moisture 🌱, temperature 🌡️, humidity 💧, rainfall ☔, and air quality 🌍, integrating IoT 📡 and remote sensing 📊 for real-time data transmission and visualization. The rover features an ESP32 camera module 📷for live surveillance, Bluetooth (HC-05) 🔵📶 & mobile app 📱 control, and real-time data logging on Blynk IoT 📊⚡.  

⚙️ Key Components  
🛠 Hardware: Arduino Uno 🖥️ (main controller), NodeMCU ESP8266 🌐 (Wi-Fi module), L293D motor driver ⚡ (movement & arm control), DHT11 sensor 🌡️ (temperature & humidity), Soil Moisture Sensor 💦, Rain ☔ & Air Quality Sensors 🌫️, and a N20 motor-driven mechanical arm 🔩.  
🖥️ Software: Arduino IDE 💻 (coding), Blynk IoT 📡 (remote monitoring), RC Bluetooth Car App 🚗📱 (movement control), and MIT App Inventor 🛠️ (UI for robotic arm control).  

🔄 How It Works  
1️⃣ Data Collection– Sensors collect soil & environmental data 📊.  
2️⃣ Processing– Arduino & ESP8266 process sensor readings 🖥️.  
3️⃣ Communication– Data is transmitted to Blynk IoT 📡.  
4️⃣ Control – Users control rover movement via Bluetooth mobile app 📱.  
5️⃣ Surveillance – ESP32 Camera 📷 streams live images for analysis.  

🔥 Applications  
🌾 Precision Agriculture– Soil & weather monitoring for optimized farming 🚜.  
🌍 Environmental Science– Climate data collection for research 🌱.  
🏕️ Remote Surveillance– Monitors hazardous terrains 🛰️.  

🚀 Future Enhancements
